Hello there!

Welcome to my personal page. My name's Jan and I am a financial researcher, consultant, and strategist.

My background is in credit risk research, advisory, and consulting, having built probability of default and loss-given-default models at Moody's Analytics and engaged in other miscellaneous economic and finance research and consulting projects, including IFRS9-related topics, both in-house and for clients. I've also worked in the climate risk space at Baringa Partners and Cervest.

Currently living in London, UK. Outside of work, I love hiking and I'm an avid road cycling, ice hockey, and skiing fan (and sometimes partaker).
